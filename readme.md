# Data Science for VCs

Why is Data Science important for VCs?

I = T - (R + P + M)

where:

- I is the total time allotted to making new investments in startups

- T is the total time needed to manage the fund administratively and raise new capital

- P is the time needed to work with and support the fund's portfolio

- M is the miscellaneous time used for networking events, public events, etc to raise firm's brand

If we have a lot of startups in our dataset as possible since this is the sample that we're going to choose from, then we can 



### Decision Analysis

- 100/4000 of the top investments making 100% of the profits
- There is a lot of uncertainty in VC
- Decision Analysis can help with tackling uncertainty in VC



#### Decision Making Process

- Sort Qualitatively (Market, Team, Fit)

- Create Market Map (Unit Sales, Price, Customer Segment)

- Assess Risks (Market, Product, Team, Financial)

- Quantify Uncertainties (High, Base, Low)

- Perform Sensitivity Analysis

- Calculate Risk / Return (Early Stage Success, Cross Chasm)

### Network Charts

One way of sourcing for deal-flow is through visualizing connections among VC funds based on their co-investments.

A good way of doing so is through network charts.

#### Why Network Charts?

Network charts are useful to VC funds that intend to understand:

- Competitors' interactions
- Monitoring
